Do not generate logic unless explicitly requested.

If you are requested to generate logic, add comments to explain the code and mark the code with `// Copilot`.

If code is copied with only slight modifications from elsewhere in the project, add a comment with the source file and line number.

Overall prefer to use existing code patterns and structures in the project.
